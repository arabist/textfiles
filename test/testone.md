**NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION OUTSIDE CRISIS GROUP**
 
## **I. Main Advocacy Points**

**Project priority: Libya**

- UN negotiations in Libya have made little progress and could easily falter, particularly as they are being overshadowed by events on the ground.  In particular, military and political support given by external actors (especially Egypt, France and the UAE) to the camp Haftar appears to have encouraged him to renege on his promise to support a negotiated process.
- Given the risk of the negotiations stalling, it is key to nonetheless make progress on issues of economic governance that affect ordinary Libyans' lives. The UN and the international community should focus on improving the functioning of economic institutions (particularly the Central Bank of Libya, the National Oil Corporation and the Libyan Investment Authority) and ensuring they cooperate with the Government of National Accord to address the lack of liquidity, the Libyan dinar's devaluation and the smuggling of subsidised fuel.

## **II. Country Analysis**
 
### **1. Algeria**

#### A. Developments and Analysis

With preparations underway for local elections on 23 November, critics from a broad spectrum including from within the ruling coalition are highlighting violations and irregularities. Leading opposition parties from across the political spectrum including the Socialist Forces Front (FFS), the Movement of Society for Peace (MSP), and the Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD) each reported having multiple candidate dossiers rejected by the administration for reasons ranging from unpaid fines to unspecified infringements, while entire lists were rejected on account of French/Arabic transliteration issues. Many who are currently blocked from registering as candidates already hold local office and are difficult to replace. The elections are expected to expand and consolidate power for the two ruling parties, the National Liberation Front (FLN) and National Democratic Rally (RND) within municipal councils. Since one government response to economic crisis has been to adopt a “do it yourself” posture towards local councils, which stand to receive less and less in state funding, these positions are more significant now than they were in 2012, when the last local elections were held.

The frustration caused by the sentiment of shrinking political space and democracy recently led the usually pro-regime Workers’ Party (PT) leader Louisa Hanoune to declare to a meeting of unemployed workers in Ouargla, “We have no faith in this government.” On 13 November, Hadda Hazem, director of the daily El Fadjr newspaper, began a hunger strike in protest of what she says is a ban on public advertising designed to bankrupt her publication because of her critical stance. Authorities blocked the leading online news source Tout Sur l’Algerie (TSA) for several weeks starting 5 October.

France and Algeria are tightening bilateral relations, with French ministers of economy and foreign affairs Bruno Le Maire and Jean-Yves Le Drian visiting Algiers on 12 November  for the fourth annual session of the Franco-Algerian Mixed Economic Committee (COMEFA), which produced the signing of several agreements, including the establishment of a years-delayed Peugeot assembly factory in Algeria. French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to visit Algiers on December 6.

On 22 October, the National Popular Army (ANP) killed two militants in the northeast at Jijel. On 24 October the ANP killed three more in ongoing operations in the same region. On 31 October, it killed an arms trafficker who opened fire on soldiers in the southeastern Illizi. On 8 November, ANP killed two militants and seized weapons in Bouira just east of Algiers.

### **2. Egypt**

#### A. Developments and Analysis

President Abdelfattah al-Sisi continues to exacerbate the contradiction between domestic policy and his international persona as he works to sell Egypt as an inclusive and welcoming society. With crackdowns continuing, Sisi inaugurated a controversial Global Youth Forum in early November, using the public relations efforts to detract focus from a worsening security situation that earlier this month resulted in a security reshuffle that struck the heart of Sisi’s inner circle. 

A failed raid on a militant training camp in Wahat, just 155km west of Cairo in the Western Desert, resulted on 21 October in a deathly ambush that officially killed 16 state security officers and conscripts. Unofficial outlets record a death toll as high as 55, with dozens more wounded. No group claimed initially responsibility for the ambush, although many to a return of infamous military officer-turned-jihadist, Hisham al-Ashmawy and his group Al Murabitoon, believed to be based in eastern Libya. On November 3, a little-known jihadist group called Ansar al Islam (affiliated with al-Qaeda) claimed responsibility for the attack, though their unofficial leader – who was killed days before the ambush according to the group's statement - Emad El Din Hamed has close links to Ashmawy, raising suspicion that the group may simply be a rebranded form of al-Murabitoon.

This does point to a potential resurgence of al-Qaeda in Egypt. In Northern Sinai, an Qaeda-affiliated group called Jund al-Islam claimed on 11 November an ambush attack against an Islamic State unit in North Sinai that occurred in late October. While there are little details about the attack, ISIS acknowledged that two of its members were killed in the attack. Little is known about Jund Al Islam, which surfaced in 2013 when it claimed two attacks in North Sinai and then claimed responsibility for a rocket fired into Israel in 2015. Some analysts point to the possible exhaustion of ISIS' Sinai Province and the resurgence of AQ activity (Sinai Province's predecessor, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, was AQ-affiliated; some its members refused to give ISIS their allegiance in 2014.)   

The attack and its proximity to the capital sparked widespread condemnation of the government. Some MPs collectively called for the minister of interior to attend a parliamentary session to answer questions on the attack, while media figures across televisions condemned the government's lack of transparency and demanded Sisi provide details. One such pro-state TV anchor, Ahmed Moussa, known for his ties to security services, was even taken off the air and referred to the general prosecutor over claims of “harming national security” for airing a recorded phone conversation between officers involved in the ambush and officers at the Police hospital in Cairo, where the injured had been treated.

Sisi's lack of reaction also brought much ire, as he kept to his scheduled events. The morning after the attack, Sisi attended the 75-year anniversary of the Battle of El Alamein (October 1942), met with the Australian Governor-General and other commonwealth representatives, and officially opened El-Alamein City, although the ceremony was a much more muted affair than had been planned. The reaction was stark in comparison to similar attacks against the military, when the president ordered days of mourning and public state funerals. 

The Wahat attack resulted on 28 October in arguably the largest security reshuffle since Sisi’s presidency began, with the most senior security personnel in Giza governates removed along with the head of National Security (the main domestic agency under the ministry of interior). These sackings were overshadowed by the removal of arguably one of Sisi’s closest aides, Armed Forces Chief of Staff Mahmoud Hegazy (who is father-in-law to Sisi’s youngest son). He has been appointed presidential advisor, but outside the senior military chain of command. Hegazy was the coordinator for Egypt's Libya policy, a role it is not clear he will continue to play, although no changes have been announced thus far.

Details of the attack have been hard to come by; however, it appears to have been primarily a mass intelligence failure on behalf of both Military Intelligence, which oversee the borders, and General Intelligence, including the failure to understand the potency and size of the threat posed by the training camp. The police were quick to confirm the attempted raid, however notably highlighted that communication failures had resulted in no back-up or effective cover from the military when needed. 
	
Leftist politician Khaled Ali has officially announced his run for the presidency in next year’s elections, scheduled for May 2018. While candidate registration is not expected to open before February 2018, Ali announced his run on November 6, soon a campaign by Sisi supporters to prepare his re-election were launched. There are no signs yet of other serious candidates emerging. As such, Ali runs the risk of becoming the sole candidate against Sisi. 

Sisi weighed in on the resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri while speaking at the Global Youth Forum on 7 November, insisting that the region did not need further tension and that inciting Iran or Hizbollah was in no-one’s interests. This marked a distancing from Saudi policy, despite Egypt's reliance on Riyadh's financial aid. Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry reaffirmed the Egypt's opposition against interference from Iran in a statement released 12 November as he met with Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman.

### 3. **Libya**

#### A. Developments and Analysis

UN SRSG Ghassan Salamé’s negotiations to amend the Libyan Political Agreement continued but key questions remain regarding the governing framework and security arrangements, in particular Article 8 of the Agreement which relates to the appointment of military leadership and is viewed by supporters of Khalifa Haftar as a threat to his position. Salamé told the UN Security Council on November 16 that he was confident consensus on the remaining issues was close and that preparations were underway for the holding of a National Conference - the second step in his action plan - in February. The process of selecting participants for the conference is likely to be dogged by the same questions of representation and legitimacy that have slowed the UN dialogue since late 2014. 

Meanwhile, the UN negotiations continue to be overshadowed by developments on the ground, with military escalations in both east and west. Airstrikes on the eastern town of Derna killed 16 civilians on 31 October, most of them children. The town had previously been subjected to air raids by both Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) and Egypt but no one has claimed responsibility for the latest airstrikes, which prompted outrage across Libya, even among Haftar’s support base. The months-long LNA siege of Derna has also drawn criticism from a wide range of Libyans, including prominent figures who previously supported Haftar.

Haftar also faced a challenge in Benghazi from Faraj Ghaim, the Government of National Accord (GNA)’s deputy interior minister. The bid by Ghaim -- who is from the powerful eastern Awagir tribe,  which is divided over Haftar -- to rally anti-Haftar sentiment met with little success. Few Awagur figures are willing to openly challenge Haftar. Several of Ghaim’s associates have since been detained and figures working with the GNA have been threatened with arrest. While this is unlikely to be the last attempt to challenge Haftar in Benghazi and the wider east, the failure of Ghaim’s initiative will discourage others for now. 

Haftar’s plans to expand his influence in western Libya also suffered a setback with the GNA-aligned military campaign launched at the beginning of November by Osama Juwaili, the head of Zintan’s Military Council and GNA-appointed commander of the western region military zone. After forming a coalition comprised of Zintani forces -- including some erstwhile Haftar allies -- and Haithem Tajouri’s Tripoli Revolutionaries Brigade among others, Juwaili took control of al-Aziziya, the main town of the Warshefana tribe whose territory is located on Tripoli’s hinterland. Presented as an “anti-crime” operation (elements of the Warshefana have long been accused of crimes including kidnapping in Tripoli), Juwaili’s campaign also served to blunt the LNA threat to the capital given the links between some Warshefana factions -- some of them Gaddafi sympathisers -- and Haftar.

The question is whether the new alliances forged by Juwaili will hold and whether his coalition can maintain control of al-Aziziya. If that happens, the knitting together of armed groups under Juwaili’s command could bolster the GNA push towards a military unification which in turn could further undermine Haftar.

### 4. **Tunisia**

#### A. Developments and Analysis

The growing friction between the two heads of the executive, President Béji Caïd Essebsi and Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, is polarizing the political scene, reflecting deeper tensions. Within the next few months, this conflict is expected to end with Essebsi asking Chahed to request parliament for a renewal of confidence and not obtain it, as was the case with the previous prime minister, Habib Essid, in July 2016. Since this summer, Essebsi has considered Chahed to be a potential a future rival for himself or for his preferred successor (perhaps his son Hafedh) in the 2019 presidential elections. The leadership of coalition partner An-Nahda as well as much of Essebsi's own Nida Tounes party (lead by Hafedh), has interpreted Chahed’s anti-corruption campaign, launched in May 2017, as a direct threat to their political and economic interests. An-Nahda leader Rached Ghannouchi is betting on Essebsi maintaining the current governmental and parliamentary coalition between An-Nahda and Nida Tounes, which still represents the majority of parliament (124 out of 217 MPs), creating an opportunity for the Islamist party in the 2019 elections.  

The influential business association UTICA may lend backing to such a move. It views Chahed’s current policies as too fiscally onerous (the draft 2018 budget increases numerous taxes on corporations and increases scrutiny of tax payments). Entrepreneurs in the informal sector, especially contraband, consider Chahed’s struggle against corruption to be a repressive tool used for political purposes. 

Politically, Chahed -- a member of Nida Tounes but marginal in the party -- is increasingly isolated. He nevertheless enjoys the support of 40 MPs from a new parliamentary front, the Front Parlementaire Centriste, that includes dissidents from Nida Tounes and Afek Tounes, a liberal party and a member of the governing coalition, to “reestablish parliamentary balance by the unification of visions and positions” according to its founding statement released on 13 November. 

Fearing an exodus of Nida Tounes MPs to this new parliamentary bloc, Nida Tounes and An-Nahda have cut a deal with businessman-turned-politician Slim Riahi, the president of the Free Patriotic Union (12 seats). They have agreed to reinforce their comfortable majority inside plenary sessions and commissions of the parliament by forming a new parliamentary alliance, dubbed by some journalists as “the new Troika”, gathering 136 out of 217 MPs.  

Behind the scenes, numerous kinds of pressures are being put on Chahed, who still has the support of the leadership of the powerful UGTT trade union federation, which is happier with the draft 2018 budget, and half of the leftist and liberal parliamentary and extra-parliamentary political formations that view Chahed as opposed to Islamists and business mafias. The National Security Council – a monthly or bi-monthly gathering of ministers, secretaries of states and senior security officials led by the president – has asked  Chahed to transfer it responsibility for anti-corruption measures. If implemented, this would further weaken the prime minister, depriving him of considerable leverage he has tended to use to strengthen his position against Essebsi, Nida Tounes and An-Nahda.

To summarize, three years after the last general elections, Tunisia has an unstable and fragile governing coalition, with a backdrop of economic degradation, widespread pessimism, and renewed anti-Islamist and anti-democratic sentiment that is amplified by regional polarisation. There is increased fear of authoritarian backlash.

On 1 November a would-be jihadist attacked a security patrol next to the parliament, killing one policeman. The attack rekindled the debate about a controversial law for the protection of security forces that critics say would restore the impunity they enjoyed under the former regime.  

On 14 November, after long delays, the parliamentary majority agreed on a consensual figure, Mohamed Tlili Mansiri,  as president of Independent High Electoral Commission (ISIE), which will organise municipal elections in 2018 (no date defined officially) and presidential and legislative elections by end-2019. This has increased confidence that the municipal elections will be held in 2018, after four postponements.

### **5. Western Sahara**

#### A. Developments and Analysis

The King of Morocco reiterated in a televised speech on 7 November his unequivocal backing for the Moroccan proposal for an “autonomy” under Moroccan rule, saying, “The Western Sahara will be Moroccan until the end of time, no matter what sacrifices we must make.” On 27 October, Moroccan authorities expelled a delegation of five European Union deputies traveling to the disputed territory for a human rights mission. On 1 November, a Polisario court sentenced 19 Moroccans charged with drug trafficking to heavy prison sentences ranging from 15 to 17 years.
